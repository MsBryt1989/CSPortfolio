## CS210 Project 3 - Grocery Store Sales Data Analysis

## Overview
This project, developed as part of the CS210 course at Chada Tech, focuses on analyzing sales data for a grocery store. The program tracks the frequency of items purchased, presents this information in various formats, and ensures data persistence through a backup file.

## How to Run
To run this program, compile the `source.cpp` file and execute the program. Ensure the `CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt` is in the correct directory. The program will generate a `frequency.dat` file as a backup.

## Reflection
1. **Summary**: This project analyzes sales data, providing key functionalities like item frequency tracking and histogram visualization.
